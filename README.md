## 🤔 What is the purpose of this repository?

🚦🏃‍♂️⏱️

***- This repository contains a game where the goal is to cross a road in 10 seconds.*** 

🚗💥🚂

***- However, players must be careful as they can be hit by a car at any moment, and if not, a train will do the job!*** 

😵🔄⌛

***- The twist is that players are stuck in a time loop, where they must overcome the same road over and over again.***
